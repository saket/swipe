`swipe` builds composables that can be swiped left or right for revealing actions. Unlike [SwipeToDismiss](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/package-summary#SwipeToDismiss(androidx.compose.material.DismissState,androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,kotlin.collections.Set,kotlin.Function1,kotlin.Function1,kotlin.Function1)), it is designed for swipe actions that _do not_ dismiss their composable.

```groovy
implementation "me.saket.swipe:swipe:1.0.0"
```

```kotlin
val archive = SwipeAction(
  icon = painterResource(R.drawable.archive),
  background = Color.Green,
  onSwipe = { … }
)

val snooze = SwipeAction(
  icon = painterResource(R.drawable.snooze),
  background = Color.Yellow,
  isUndo = true,
  onSwipe = { … },
)

SwipeableActionsBox(
  startActions = listOf(archive),
  endActions = listOf(snooze)
) {
  // Swipeable content goes here.
}
```
